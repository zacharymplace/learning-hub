Welcome—this is my working notebook for patterns I reuse: data wrangling, finance ops, docs, and creative tooling.

> Goal: ship **copy-paste-ready** building blocks with brief rationale and sane defaults.

## Start here
- **How-To**: short, practical guides you can follow in 5–10 minutes.
- **Snippets**: reusable code blocks with minimal dependencies.
- **Reference**: naming, structure, and conventions that keep things tidy.

---

### What’s inside
- **Pandas I/O Cheats** – fast patterns for CSV/Excel/Parquet, types, and perf.
- **Mermaid → PNG** – export diagrams for decks or SOPs without local tooling.
- **Snippets (SQL/Python)** – ready to drop into day-to-day work.
